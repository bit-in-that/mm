He does in in an unconventional way, he kicks the ball more than the average ruck, which sees him have higher clangers and lower disposal efficiency. However, he makes up for these with his ability to fill all stat categories and generates scores through transition movement as much as stoppages. His season included a 51 when he battled with a knee complaint in Round 6 which he backed up with a 63, so that 112 could have been higher. The threat of the Saints playing a second ruck has always been there given he shoulders so much of the load. The good news is the two candidates - Tom Campbell and Jack Hayes - have both been delisted. Saints drafted the number one ruck prospect in the draft, but he'll need time. However, the SSP signing of 26-year-old ruck Harry Boyd is certainly cause for concern. To make matters worse, Marshall is touch and go for Round 1 following a stress fracture in his pelvis. I'm not as concerned with him losing this training block as I am the Saints protecting him during the season. I can't see him rucking 85% as he's done the last two years which means a regression is certainly on the cards.

While no one could have seen this level of scoring coming, the writing was on the wall. In 2022 he averaged 105 in the VFL (including a game with 36 disposals and 27 hit-outs) and finished 2nd in the BnF, despite playing just half the games. 2023 he got his chance but was injured in the first quarter of Round 1, but led the league for points per minute after his two games as solo ruck before Goldy returned to the team. With Goldy gone in 2024, Xerri finally arrived. He ranked 3rd for tackles in the comp (only ruck in the top 24) and 8th in clearances (number one ruck). Of the top five tackling ruckmen at stoppages, he was 50 clear of the next best - that's over two a game. Outliers of this extreme could lead to a regression and a better performing Roos team shouldn't be as reliant on their big man shouldering all the load. But tackling and following up is in his nature. He's always done it and it's not going to go away. We could see a period where Xerri is the top scoring player for multiple seasons. Priced at 120 and with some cheaper options presenting in the ruck such as TDK and Flynn, you can take him on. But if you want someone priced as a captain option, he'd be the one I'd take.

It's also good to see him back in his natural position, after Leon Cameron played him up the ground in his last two seasons. My hesitation last year was that the Giants had a number of distributors - Himmelberg, Cumming and Ash being the main competitors. In the end, Whitfield averaged the 3rd highest percentage of kick-ins across the league, so he was their clear main man and will likely remain that way.

He was in All-Australian discussions in his 2nd season on a wing and caught the eye of SuperCoaches when averaging 128 in a 6-game stretch, bucking the trend of what is typically a low scoring position. So when he moved to half back at the start of last season, expectations were high. He delivered, averaging 122 in the first eight rounds and displaying the thirst for the footy we love as SuperCoaches. But outside of us coaches, his new role output attracted some criticism - with many suggesting he was far more damaging when playing on a wing than getting cheap touches in D50. Brad Scott obviously agreed, as he moved him back to the wing and a forward-of-centre role after Round 8. While his scoring wasn't as prolific (only two x 100+ score from Round 15 to Round 20), it was still very impressive, averaging 102 in this time including 121 in his L3. His price tag is very high for someone not playing one of the two roles we want - inside mid or rebounding half-back - so he doesn't present as a great starting option, but the defender status and talk of him playing more inside in 2025 means he could end up being a top six defender. I'm not willing to start with him though unless we see that role change in the pre-season games.","Averaged 122 as a HB distributor but moved to the wing/HF mid-season where his scoring dropped a little (102), but still showed a high ability to score - inside role possible in 2025 could see him go higher",NULL,108,126,9,NULL,25,8,9,133,27,0,142,63," 7 / 23"," 10 / 23"," 4 / 23"," 1 / 23"," 0 / 23",0,0,1,2,2,0,NULL,0,18,20,15,7,18,NULL,105,0,103,2,108,-3,112,-7,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,105,79,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,74,145,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,111,90,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,28.3,73.7,23.0,3.8,2.3,5.0,27.0,81.1,30.4,2.7,2.6,5.3,"Intercepts",3,9,105,88,35,90,111,98,17,9,105,NULL,1.3,5.0,0.0,0.7,1.7,5.3,0.0,0.3

But he still had periods that brought back memories of 2023, with five sub-100 scores from Round 6 to 16. The game is speeding up, with less stoppages and tackle opportunities and at times Steele looks like he can't keep up. However, he still showed he can be an elite player in this game, bookmarking that mid-season slump with 130 in the first five rounds, so maybe he was carrying something mid-season.

Hitouts have never been his strong suit, but ruckmen normally peak after 25 and both Gawn and Grundy improved their average in the year following their first season averaging 110+. We typically see greater consistency in the top ruck tier than the other positions, which is why English's 25(!) point regression in 2024 was such a shock. There was a change in the ruck rule where players were able to hold a player out while the ball was in the air which didn't play into English's favour. However, it was the ease he was pushed off the ball that was alarming. I'm prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was carrying something, more than it all being down to the rule change.

What helps him is the number of quality small forwards at the Hawks, so not only does he not have to play the typical small forward role (Watson and Ginni have that covered), he also avoids the best small defender. Moore had glandular fever in the preseason last year which explains his slow start but finished with a bang - 105 post bye.

He missed the first three games of the season with a hamstring injury and then 10 weeks in the middle of the year with a calf. It's not the first time he's dealt with soft tissue injuries and is a big reason why the 2021 All-Australian's numbers have dropped off since. It could be easy to say that if he can regain full fitness, he could be the underpriced mid we're looking for.

However, he boosted his average by 20 points per game in 2024 and included four games with 120+.

It forced Chris Scott's hand who moved the star defender into the middle in what was one of the positional moves of the season.

He got going after this, winning Hawks' B&F and finishing with 24 Brownlow votes. However, he averaged 104 points per game following Round 5, which was still well below the top eight mids. I can put it down to two things. Newcombe has below average tackle numbers (4.4 v 5.2 of the top 8) which is a shock given he set the AFL record for tackles on debut with 14. The Hawks also play a very quick game style, which results in low scoring for their midfield - ranked 13th in the comp (WC, Rich, Geelong and Dees the only ones worse in 2024). It makes me question whether he can push his average to the 110s, which he'll need to do to make him a successful starting pick.

His Coates Talent League numbers were also great, managing to hit the scoreboard frequently for 12 goals from nine games and averaging 29.4 disposals and 112 SuperCoach points. His debut season wasn't all smooth sailing though. We all hoped he would step straight into the ‘Sheezel role’, and while he did start in defence, he was also used as a mid at times and injured himself early on just two in Round 5. It was after this where he moved back to a genuine half back role, and from Round 7 to 9 he had 24 kick-ins, after taking just five in the first six weeks. He averaged 109 in these games, however developed a stress fracture to his foot which saw him miss the next seven weeks. He returned in the same role, taking over five kick-ins in each of the last seven games for an average of 105. He's eventually going to be a midfielder and like we saw with Sheezel, that could happen as soon as this year. There is also talk of him playing on a wing. In the short term, we'd rather him stay in defence and while Daniel is expected to take up a lot of the kick-ins, any talk of McKercher playing back there would be enough for me to lock him into my starting team. 14 FEB UPDATE: Sounds like he's more wing/HFF than the HB role we hoped.

He did this off an ACL, so now heading into his first full pre-season, Ashcroft is poised to take his game to the next level. He's no doubt going to be a star of the comp and he has the attributes to be a SuperCoach stud also, with his ability to generate uncontested marks (5.2 marks per game v 4.4 of the top eight mids) along with his natural ball-winning ability. His tackle count (2.5 per game v 5.2 of the top 8) will improve as he gets more time in the middle (27% CBAs in 2024, increased to 43% in finals) as will his contested rate (32% v 44% of the top eight mids).

It was obviously fast-tracked by Oliver and Petracca missing, but I can see him maintaining that role even with them returning in 2025. He'll have to play 4th fiddle though, with Viney the other regular in the Demons midfield. In the past, the 4th mid for the Dees hasn't averaged much (Sparrow/Jordon/Hames/ANB all averaging less than 80 in 2023 when playing the 4th banana), but they never had the natural SuperCoach game of Rivers.

It led to an off-season move to the Roos who are crying out for someone of his calibre.

He's priced at 66 and could be a super pick. UPDATE: Training heavily with the mids and with Wardlaw expected to miss the first chunk of the year, he's the like-for-like replacement.

He then moved into the midfield and his output has been down ever since.

Removing those injured scores, he hasn't been as bad as it looks. Adding to this, Rioli moved to the Gold Coast in the off-season, meaning there should be more ball for Short in 2025. The only concern is that Richmond are going to be bad, so their total team points are likely to be the lowest in the comp. Can Short manage a 100+ average in a team that will likely get smashed most weeks? If there's a position that can, it would be in defence given the amount of ball being back there.

This was a week before he had 30 disposals (16 contested), eight clearances and a goal against the Pies, however injured his hamstring in the final minute which halted his momentum. In his second game back from injury, he had 27 touches (14 contested), six clearances and two goals and the discussions started again, before he was suspended for four weeks for his hit on Starcevich who had a defensive role on him. He missed the final game after being concussed in Round 23. Amongst the interrupted season, the Crows found the line-breaking, goal kicking midfield they've been starved of. In the nine matches Rankine attended over 30% CBAs, he averaged 107.

In his first season at Freo, he surpassed 100 11 times, and averaged 60% CBAs in those 11, including a monster 173 when he had 88%. He also had eight sub-90 games, and averaged 28% CBAs in those eight. In 2024, he surpassed 100 six times and averaged 72% CBAs in those and 11 sub-70 games averaging 44%. Fair to say he can score when playing as the number one ruck, but when forced to spend more time forward, he scores like a key forward. Freo have signed Sean Darcy for the long-term and hope to have him on the park more in 2025, so it's hard to see Jackson having an avenue to consistent scoring unless Darcy goes down again. There is every chance this can happen based on Darcy's injury history, but for now Jackson isn't an attractive starting option. 6 FEB UPDATE: Darcy is set to miss the start of the season. If he goes into Round 1 solo, he's no doubt an attractive option in the forward line, priced at 95 when he averages 109-118 in that role. However, Freo rucked Reidy in Round 24 and kept Jackson forward, so I don't think I'd do it.

The former pick 13 averaged 68 in his first season after 35 disposals per game in SANFL Under-18s in his draft year. After a strong pre-season, Powell played every game in 2024 for a 80 average. His role was still up and down though. When he attended 50%+ CBAs, he averaged 93 and showed some great clearance work. He also had a game playing half-back, where he scored 101. In his other games, where he averaged just 30% CBAs, he averaged 66. I think he can play and he's shown he can score in the right role. However, with Parker and FOS adding to their midfield and Daniel set to play the half back role, I'm not sure where that puts Powell in 2025, so I'm not interested in taking a punt unless I get confirmation of a 70%+ CBA role or a half back one.

Nothing went right in 2022, a broken thumb, sore groins and then an Achilles injury that kept him out of the first practice match and Round 1. The recruitment of Luke Jackson quelled any chance of a bounce back in 2023, however he still managed to average 111 after he returned from injury mid-season. Darcy managed just 12 games last season, three of which he lasted less than 50% TOG and another he missed the rest of the season after. It's been the story for the last few seasons as he's struggled to stay on the park. He's heading into his age 26 season, so he should be at his peak as a ruck. Following his 2021 season where he was talked about as a potential All-Australian ruck (even with a knee injury in the pre-season and a PCL injury mid-year impacting what could've been a higher average), he hasn't been able to do a full pre-season. Off-season knee surgery will limit his pre-season again, but he got onto it early this time so hopefully he can complete more than he has done in the past. The reports are that he's in good shape, however Freo will likely take a cautious approach, especially as they have Luke Jackson who is more than capable in the ruck. The risk is there, but I think he can manage that level if he can get through which would make him a great starting pick. The risk is reduced with the best 18 rounds early in the year, so if he looks the goods in the practice matches (noting he missed practice matches in each of the last three seasons), then I'd be confident enough to start him. UPDATE: A trip to Doha in Jan was unexpected and I'm not sure what to make of it. Has he had a setback or was it always part of the plan and will he now come back stronger? I guess the pre-season game will tell. 6 FEB UPDATE: So he's getting surgery on his ankle and will miss the start of the season. Cross him off your starting plans. Might still come at good value in draft.

However in recent times, he's been dealt with some horrible luck, including doing his third ACL in Round 0 last year. He miraculously recovered to play in the finals, so he's good to go for the 2025 season. However, there are still some question marks. Prior to the knee injury, Docherty had been playing midfield/wing. He averaged a career high 22% CBAs in 2023, which increased as the Blues went on their winning streak in the second half of the season. He maintained his role in Round 0. His scoring is less prolific playing in the midfield than half back, so we certainly want to see him move back behind the ball to make the decision to start a lot easier. If not, with MID-only status, you'd want him to average mid-90s to prove a good starting selection which is a big ask for someone with the injury history of Doch. Until we see his role in pre-season, it's going to be hard to declare Doch as an absolute lock, despite the obvious discount he comes with. UPDATE: Newman out for the year gives greater chance of Doch moving back, but still as a MID-only I think there are better mid-prices available. 28 FEB UPDATE: Bumped down a bit after seeing him in the pre-season game, out of my starting calcs despite the soft first up match up.","Former SuperCoach stud who recovered from a 3rd ACL in Round 0 to play a final, obvious discount on what he can do but body, role and age add a lot of risk, Newman out helps the role chances",NULL,46,78,41,NULL,93,NULL,7,118,-8,-24,75,25," 0 / 2"," 0 / 2"," 2 / 2"," 1 / 2"," 1 / 2",0,10,NULL,NULL,5,10,10,0,0,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,25,66,25,66,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,75,16,NULL,16,115,110,98,92,0,0,115,37,19,40,69,NULL,NULL,3,127,127,113,112,0,0,123,-65,12,6,-22,NULL,NULL,6,13.0,61.3,27.8,3.5,1.5,1.0,28.2,69.1,43.7,3.5,4.5,6.2,"Clearances",99,125,75,99,457,44,92,118,-49,-11,50,NULL,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.5,6.2,2.9,0.0,0.8

After a breakout season in 2020 which saw him increase his average by 22 points per game, he improved again in 2021 to 97 points per game and 105 post-bye. However, he stagnated in 2022, despite increased CBA minutes, but still managed a respectable 91. Since then, nothing has gone right. In 2023 as he battled with multiple injuries - a hand injury and two concussions - which saw him have three games with less than 50% game time (12, 24 and 66) and drop his average by 12 points per game. Removing those games he averaged 88, which is still a level below his best, but it's hard to hit peak form if you miss regular games for injury. It was a similar story last year, with Simpkin on the end of a significant concussion in the practice match and missed Round 1. He also tore a tendon in his finger in the first practice match and was forced to wear a glove for the first two months of the season. He then missed four games from Round 8 with a quad complaint, but returned to post a season high 129 from a then season high 65% CBAs, after averaging 35% until then. But once again, injury hit and he missed the following week with hamstring tightness. He played out the rest of the year averaging 94, mixing his time between forward and the midfield. With forward status, he can certainly contend with the top six if he averages his career best 97, but that was from a 84%+ CBA role. However, with the Roos increasing their midfield depth, I feel like we might see Simpkin spend more time forward in 2025 which will limit his scoring. I just want to confirm his mid/forward split in the pre-season but I'm a bit more confident in the other forwards playing a better role. UPDATE: Wardlaw going down could see Simpkin getting the midfield split we want from him, a big watch in the pre-season games but he's shaping up as a potential starting option - we how have a few to pick from in the forward line!","Has stagnating since 2022 and multiple injuries over the last two seasons have impacted his average, but has he missed his midfield opportunity now?",NULL,0,0,18,NULL,29,8,2,107,-6,-17,129,43," 1 / 18"," 4 / 18"," 12 / 18"," 9 / 18"," 0 / 18",65,27,65,59,49,44,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,80,0,58,22,94,-14,92,-12,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,97,91,97,93,71,66,47,118,81,43,68,146,147,186,120,105,117,120,92,87,67,-18,-6,4,22,5,19,NULL,21.0,68.1,44.4,3.8,3.1,0.6,17.6,68.2,47.4,2.9,3.2,1.6,"Goals",20,17,80,79,151,147,94,102,0,-12,80,NULL,4.1,1.7,0.0,0.6,2.9,1.5,0.8,1.6

Since then, he's always been on the radar but it's always hard for kids to get a run in the mature Sydney team and in his seven career matches prior to last season he was predominantly used as sub. However, a move to half-back saw him play regular football last season, playing 23 games. He started strong (90 in first six games) but tired in the middle period where he was rested for a game and used as sub on multiple occasions. Then he got on a roll, averaging 111 in the last seven rounds of the season (114 in L5). He's a natural scorer and the end to 2024 gives hope that he has another level to go in 2025, however with Blakey, Lloyd and possibly Mills all demanding their share of distribution, it's hard to see how Roberts will sustain a 100+ average which you'd want from him at that price.

More impressively, he was more impactful IRL than his SuperCoach 97 average suggested. He displayed a great balance of inside ball winning ability and tackles with outside run and marks. I was excited to see how he was going to back it up given he was still so raw and only had one year playing in the middle, however a pre-season foot injury saw him miss the first six weeks of the season. He was scratchy in his return, with a big loss to the Swans, where he scored 67 from 64% TOG. He backed it up with 58 and 89 in a clear sign as to why we don't like interrupted pre-seasons. He then got going, averaging 114 for a 10-week period before scoring just 53 from a full game in Round 21 and then was subbed off 'tactically' in Round 22 on just 40, a clear sign that he wasn't 100% (he did cop some heavy collisions in the month prior). His season ended the following week when he injured his collarbone on just 10, leaving him with a season average (and priced at for 2025) of 91. I have no doubt he is a 105+ midfielder on what I've seen when healthy. 105 isn't enough in SC as it won't be enough to be a top eight mid, nor generate the 150k to make the inevitable trade worthwhile. However, if he can push 110, which he did for the 10-week stretch, then he'll be a knockout pick as an underpriced premium. Let’s see how he goes in Round 0. 10 MAR UPDATE: The 4 price rises are going to be significant following his 148 in Round 0.

After back-to-back 109+ seasons possessing the perfect marks/tackle combo we crave in SuperCoach, nothing has gone right since. In 2023 he dropped his average by a massive 25 points per game on the back of being forced to play a key defensive role early while many of the Swans' key backs went down (averaged 12% CBAs from Round 4-6, including 0% in Round 5 and averaged 84 in that time) and then popping a calf in the first minute of Round 9 when he just started building in the midfield (47% then 63% CBAs in Round 7 and 8, scoring 110 in the latter) when on 3. He returned in Round 15 when Swans beat WC by 171 and was subbed off just after half time on another low score, so the 84 season average had legitimate excuses. So when you see he averaged 14 points less than that in 2024 makes you really question things. It started on Mad Monday 2023 where he injured his shoulder and then suffered a calf injury just as he was nearing a return, meaning he missed the first 17 weeks. He returned in Round 18, scoring 44 from 62% TOG (0% CBAs), then missed the following week after pulling up sore. His defensive attributes and versatility has always been a burden for him in SuperCoach, often shifted to be the loose man in defence or to a wing and play behind the ball. But never key defence. He played the final five games, averaging just 59 in the next three (25% CBAs, sub 70& TOG for two of them), but finished with 91 and 107 playing a pure defensive role. He maintained this role in finals where he averaged 75 before a hamstring injury saw him miss the prelim and GF, an indication that his body just wasn't right. Looking at it now he's still just 27, so he should be in his prime. But his role is still very much an unknown, particularly with Dean Cox now in charge. If he returns to the midfield I can see him being a knockout pick at that price and he'll enter with a chip on his shoulder. If he plays in defence, I'm not so sure. Swans have Blakey, Lloyd and Roberts who take a lot of distribution. We saw Mills average 84 in the role in 2023, albeit a more lockout one, and 91 in his four games to finish last year in the role. As a defender, a high-80s average at that price should prove to be a good selection. Fortunately we get to see what he does in the Opening Round, both scoring and role, before having to make the call. But if he scores less than 80 in a defensive role, I think I'd wait til after his Round 3 bye. UPDATE: Great pre-season and playing pure mid in match-sim, I've bumped him up a bit. 24 FEB UPDATE: Foot injury will see him miss the start of the year.","Once one of the SuperCoach elite (back-to-back 112+ in '21 & '22), but had a shocking 24 months with injury, sounds like he's back fit and shaping in a midfield role, making him a perfect bounce back candidate and a top six chance",NULL,0,0,98,NULL,49,63,4,94,-19,-49,98,55," 0 / 7"," 0 / 7"," 5 / 7"," 4 / 7"," 0 / 7",0,0,NULL,NULL,15,19,NULL,8,0,NULL,NULL,2,0,NULL,74,-8,NULL,NULL,74,-8,77,-11,77,-11,NULL,-8,115,115,112,101,82,79,73,36,7,16,43,86,87,92,139,136,139,114,95,91,90,-41,3,11,20,3,6,-1,17.4,84.7,32.8,1.9,2.3,4.9,27.0,81.1,30.4,2.7,2.6,5.3,"Intercepts",18,68,74,87,198,96,99,110,-13,-28,74,NULL,0.6,4.9,0.0,0.3,1.7,5.3,0.0,0.3

He started in the opening centre bounce of 2023, however injured his hamstring in the opening minutes on one, forcing him to miss the next four weeks. He returned in Round 6 and had CBAs in his next five games, averaging 97 from 52%. However, he moved back to defence after Round 10, seeing CBAs in just one other match for the season, averaging 74 for the games he didn't get CBAs. He played 21 games last year, exclusively in defence, with no CBAs and an average of 73. He now finds himself at Collingwood on a big deal and likely to find himself in a prominent role, whether that be in defence (without Whitfield taking all the usage) or inside mid.

He went on to surpass 125 four more times in his next eight games, before injury struck and he missed four of the final six matches. Unfortunately, injuries have been a theme of his career. He played just 13 games last season, never playing more than five full games in a row due to recurring hamstring injuries. Cerra has now suffered five hamstring injuries in 12 months. He went overseas in the off-season to get to the bottom of the issues. If he's fully fit, he's no doubt a highly discounted option.

He had eight games under 90 in 2024 (from 13). Picking a player at this price, you really need them to average in the 105+, so it's going to be hard if he keeps scoring below that mark.

However, you wouldn't think that after watching him the last three seasons. Even in his good seasons, when he didn't get the inside role, he looked a shadow of himself. Unfortunately, it has been this way for the last 36 months - from 78% CBAs in 2021 to 64% in 2022, 36% in 2023 and bottoming out at 12% last season (0% post-bye). From the outside, it appears that the Dogs wanted more pace in there and didn't want to sacrifice Bont or Libba, and preferred to pair them with Richards and Treloar. He moved to the Saints in the off-season, who ironically also have a slow midfield, however they don't have the depth of the Dogs and it appears Macrae will step straight into an inside mid role. The question is does he still have it in him? At times last year I think the game had passed him but I do have to remind myself he looked similar in his glory days when pushed out of the middle. He also managed a 123 last year in a game he had 34% CBAs and averaged 146 AFL Fantasy points in his VFL games last year.

This shouldn’t come as a great surprise considering he scored over 110 twice in three games at the level in 2022. He was back in the senior side in Round 13 and didn't miss a game after that. He moved to half-back in Round 17 and played there for the final nine games of the season, averaging 76. He was back in the midfield last year with 59% CBAs but his scoring didn't pop as expected.

He averaged 83 in the first three weeks (51 AFL Fantasy which shows how much more suited he is to this game) but then clicked into gear, averaging 115 in his next 3 (80 Fantasy), including a 27 touches and a goal effort against Richmond. He was arguably best on ground in two of those games and showed that he might be a scorer after all (not many players get 27 touches as a mid in their 5th game). However, West Coast oddly rested him the next week and it halted his momentum. He averaged 76 in the next two but then scored a 138 in Round 10. In Round 12 he got going against the Saints, having 13 touches in the second quarter to be on 80 at half time. He was heavily tagged after half time and took his frustrations out on a tackle which saw him suspended. Post bye there were less highlights, but he did manage 26 touches and three behinds in Round 23 (imagine if he kicked straight). He's had a very interrupted pre-season and missed all work pre-Christmas, so he'll likely have a slow start. I doubt he'll be a relevant player in SuperCoach this year, but I no longer think he'll just be an impact player. He's going to be a premium SuperCoach player in time given how good he is.","81 average isn't eye-catching, but Reid was every bit as good as advertised, interrupted pre-season may keep him limited in 2025 but natural progression should see him continue to improve",NULL,62,86,65,NULL,83,80,64,108,NULL,0,147,48," 2 / 20"," 3 / 20"," 15 / 20"," 7 / 20"," 0 / 20",79,28,83,79,68,68,NULL,0,0,0,0,1,0,NULL,81,0,86,-5,74,7,74,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,81,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,244,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,99,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,18.5,72.7,52.7,4.6,4.0,5.0,28.2,69.1,43.7,3.5,4.5,6.2,"Clearances",7,64,81,NULL,144,NULL,99,NULL,NULL,NULL,81,NULL,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.5,6.2,2.9,0.0,0.8

However, it didn't eventuate. He was controversially subbed on in his debut on (55% TOG). He then averaged 86 in his next three games (40% CBAs) and looked like he was away. Not on Bevo's watch. He was subbed out the following week (46 from 42% TOG) and then started sub the following week (scored 15 from 24%), before being dropped to the VFL. He was a level above in the VFL, averaging 116 AFL Fantasy points in seven games. He went on to play eight more games for the season at AFL level, but only averaged 65, spending a lot of time forward which helped him get forward status this year. Who knows what Bevo will do with him this year. The Dogs do have plenty of mids (Bont, Libba, Treloar and Richards the likely main 4), but I can see Sanders being the 5th in line and if anything happens to one of the four, Sanders will be ready to make the most of his opportunity. UPDATE: Something has happened to one of the four (Treloar out for the first two months) and Sanders appears to be the man to step up.

The 2020 mid-season draftee has always been a ball winner at VFL level, where he's averaged over 90 AFL Fantasy points four years straight including 120 last season. He also saw regular games at AFL level, with a career high 19 in 2024. Six of those was as sub early in the year, however he began getting midfield opportunities when their mids were out and then became a midfield regular by the end of the year, attending 63% CBAs in the L5 games. His 65 average doesn't tell the full story. Removing the six games he was sub, his averages boosts to 91. Then if you just include the games he attended 59% or more CBAs (i.e. a full time mid role), he averaged 108. He moved to the Crows in the off-season but not without demand from other teams, so you'd think the Crows gave him a strong sell of a midfield role. There are a lot of names being thrown around for their midfield mix in 2024, but with Laird moving out I feel like Peatling will become their defensive midfielder given his elite tackling ability and an average of 60%+ CBAs is on the cards. All you need at his starting price is a low 90s average, which he's proven he can do at both levels. I'm liking him as a mid-priced pick. 27 FEB UPDATE: With Rankine having more CBAs than expected (and looking great) and Crouch still well and truly in the mix, Peatling saw 42% CBAs which is much lower than hoped.

A pre-season injury meant he wasn't available to start the season and then was forced to work hard for his spot, despite the Bombers' woes. He played seven VFL matches and had more than 30 touches in two of them. He came in for the final four games of the year and looked okay without being amazing, limited to a forward and wing role with little inside action (15% CBAs) His second season wasn't what he would've wanted either, playing just the seven games (four as sub) at AFL level and didn't attend a centre bounce, despite his stoppage game being a strength of his. In the VFL he averaged 102, up from 92 in 2023, and included a 148 to finish the year. The knock on him is his kicking, but in his third season, the Dons have to give him a crack. I'm watching with interest, as priced at 35 he could be a value starting option. UPDATE: been dominating match-sim and turning heads at training, shaping to play in the Opening Round where luckily we won't have to make a blind call on him before Round 1. If he avoids the vest and sees 40%+ CBAs, then he's a genuine starting option. Parish out only helps the situation. 14 FEB UPDATE: Full time mid role in practice match and delivered.

He was playing an unprecedented time on ground while getting decent CBAs in a stacked Bulldog midfield and used his elite run to average 112. His season then derailed after being suspended for headbutting Zach Tuohy and then a club-imposed suspension saw him miss five of the next six weeks. He never hit the early season heights when he returned, averaging 81 post bye. His CBAs then dropped in 2023 to 31% (20% post-bye) as he spent a lot of time forward. His season high CBA game (75%), he scored 121 but never saw that number again. It was enough to give him forward status for 2024 before an ACL injury ruled him out for the entire season. A lot happened in that 12-month period and he found himself to Geelong in the offseason, a club who is in need of a CBA midfielder. After missing 2024, he gets a 10% discount on his 2023 average of 80 (well down from his 2022 average of 98), meaning he's priced at 72. He's also retained the forward status so you can pick him in a forward, a line where there aren't many players who can average over 90.

And after 93 from 52% CBAs in R1, it looked like he was going to be one of the rookies for the season. However, never went above 30% after that, and despite a 89 in R3, he quickly found himself out of the Hawks' best 22, playing as sub in R5 and dropped after R6. He then played as sub a further three times and played twice in the last eight rounds. His VFL numbers were encouraging in that time, averaging 93 for the season but had two scores 119+. He entered 2024 with some hope of a breakout, however that never happened, finishing with an average of 61 from 25% CBAs. His season high score (97) came from his season high CBAs (64%), which happened to be his last game of the year. He averaged 108 in his two VFL games in a sign that he's ready to take the leap. Unfortunately, he's lost his forward status and also has the early bye.

Day out to start the year didn't even help, with Ward's H&A CBAs were a career low. He played the first five matches at 23% CBAs, but played just one of the next 11 (0% CBAs) as Day returned from injury.

In 2023 he dropped his averaged by 27 points, which was amazing given there was no injury and he was heading into his age 24 season, meaning he should be in his prime. Cumming averaged 90 in 2022 and his breakout 2021, quickly becoming the Giants' number one distributor down back as Leon played Ash on the ball and Whitfield up forward. Kingsley came in and put things straight, with Whitfield and Ash back in defence and later Himmelberg who moved back to finish the season. This pushed Cumming up to a wing, which as we know isn't a good thing for SuperCoach scoring. A pre-season calf issue followed by a hamstring injury kept him on the sidelines until Round 16 in 2024 and then another hamstring strain saw him miss GWS' last five games of the home and away season before he returned for the finals. The hope is he moves back to the half-back line at the Crows or even if he plays wing, priced at 53 he should beat that by at least 20 points. The concern is his body as he's already had a hamstring injury this pre-season. As a mid-only there is also the risk he doesn't get DPP. However, if we get an indication that he's fit and playing in defence, I think he's going to be hard to pass up at that price. 13 FEB UPDATE: Sounds like he'll be more wing than half back.

Obviously a young, tall, key defender isn't going to be SuperCoach relevant, and SDK averaged mid-60s in 2022 and 2023. He maintained that average for the first half of 2024 playing in the same role, before being introduced into the ruck, a position Geelong have been lacking for the last few years. While still very raw and displaying a low hitout win rate of 29% (far worse than Stanley 41%, Blit 37% and Conway 34%), he was able to showcase his athletic ability around the ground which led to a nice boost in SuperCoach scoring. In the five games where he attended 40 or more ruck contests, he averaged 87. In the other 15, he averaged low-50s. His brother TDK took til last season before breaking out with his 102 average. He started the year 24 years of age. SDK will be 24 at the start of 2025. So if there is any indication of him playing in the ruck in 2025 (not holding my breath knowing Chris Scott), he's going to provide great value as a defender priced at 67. 25 FEB UPDATE: Was monstered by Draper/Bryan combo in pre-season and many will jump off now, I'm still selecting as long as he's named solo in Round 1 and scores okay in Round 0.","Key position defender was introduced into the ruck in 2024 and when he was there he scored great(40+ increase), the Cats' ruck setup has been impossible to read the last few years but if he emerges as their main ruck he has a ton of value as a defender",NULL,59,71,92,NULL,105,148,95,95,9,0,135,27," 2 / 19"," 2 / 19"," 15 / 19"," 13 / 19"," 0 / 19",80,0,83,83,13,15,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,67,0,60,7,80,-13,42,25,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,67,65,27,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,393,254,401,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,80,71,33,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,38,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,14.6,74.9,45.4,2.7,1.4,4.9,27.0,81.1,30.4,2.7,2.6,5.3,"Intercepts",52,95,67,61,267,315,80,69,6,-4,67,NULL,1.3,4.9,1.2,0.2,1.7,5.3,0.0,0.3

He showed he has the makings to be a star defender of the future, but injures stopped him from a full breakout. The story was much the same in 2023. He was concussed in Round 1 on 57, forcing him to miss Round 2. He returned to average just 61 in his next nine to the bye, looking a shadow of the player that broke out a year earlier. He was so far out of form that he started as sub post-bye, which is where he scored his 23. After that, he was quoted saying ""I just thought to myself to back myself. That’s when I play my best footy, when I’m just out there, playing freely and playing on instinct"". And he did. He averaged 90 in his last seven matches, which included another injury (eye) which saw him sit off just after half time and miss two more matches. He then went to another level in the finals, averaging 102, including a best on ground performance in the prelim and 22 disposals to half time (over 100) in the GF. We were all ready to pick him last year, before he unfortunately did his knee in Round 0. He's made a full recovery and ready for 2025, coming in even more discounted at a 51 price tag. There are a few red flags such as an ACL recovery (do they rest him early fresh off a flag), fighting with Zorko for distribution duties and a Round 3 bye, but if he can manage over 80 in Round 0, which I think he can, then it's worth taking a punt on all of those. UPDATE: Sounds like he's touch and go for Round 0, so I think we need to plan our teams without him. 12 FEB UPDATE: Suffered a setback with his recovery and may miss the first month of the season.

Of all the positions, he does his best from a SuperCoach point of view playing as a half-back (was a borderline top six defender from 2019-2020). However, the fact he hasn't had defender status for the last two years shows how little he has been used there. An off-season move to the Roos is expected to see Daniel return to defence, a role that he's not just consistently averaged over 90 in, but one that other players have excelled in at the Roos (Hall, Ziebell, Sheezel, McKercher, even Fisher at times last year). He's younger than you think (28), so unless something surprising happens and he loses the half-back role, I can't see him averaging less than mid-80s which priced at 50 and as a forward makes him an automatic selection. If things go well and he is the primary user off half back, he can certainly exceed that mark and finish as a top six forward that we keep all year.

His season high of 99 came from his season high 12% CBAs and he ticked along nicely at VFL level averaging 107 AF.

There was no under-age football in his draft year, so we had to rely on his 2019 year where he played as a 17-year-old for Oakleigh Chargers, a team that boasted Matt Rowell, Noah Anderson and Will Phillips in the midfield. Finlay was forced to play mostly across half-forward but showed some great signs and from all reports was more advanced than his (half) brother who by contrast only came good during the second half of his draft year. However, despite putting up consistent numbers in the VFL since being drafted (average over 90), he is yet to lock in a regular spot in the Pies' 22. His career high games is nine and TOG of 52%, which shows that when he is selected he's often used as the sub.

It's the role every football team wants but it's a very hard role to play, and when it comes to SuperCoach, typically these players are better IRL than their scores suggest. He certainly didn't go on with it in his second season, averaging 9 points per game less than his debut year. He was pretty well eliminated from the centre bounce rotation (4% post-bye after 17% in 2023) and as a pure forward, it's going to be very hard for him to score.

He didn't play again at AFL level that season, but after a 158 at VFL level, he featured in Round 7 in 2023 for the first time since. He was subbed out on just 18 and went back to the VFL where he scored a 130. He played again at AFL level in Round 10 where he started sub and scored just 9, and also played VFL that week for a 118. So while his career scores at AFL read 43, 11 and 9, he showed at the level below that he had something special. We then finally saw him get a decent run at AFL level, playing four games in a row at 87, despite playing just 64% TOG. He then did his syndesmosis in Round 17 on 46, and he didn't feature again. Then nothing went right in 2024. He broke a finger in a VFL practice match (so he wasn't in line for their Opening Round game) and missed the next three weeks. He returned to the VFL in Round 4 with a 120, and followed it up with 109, 103 and 89. He then injured his ankle on 6 the following game and missed six weeks. He played the final five games in the VFL, which included a game with 36 touches and 114 points in the second last round of the year. He's a genuine scorer. The issue is, where does he fit in the Swans midfield, or team at all.

He was in good form in the VFL prior to that breakout game, collecting 27, 23 (and eight tackles) and 32 disposals and two goals in the three weeks leading in. He's highly rated internally and I wouldn't be surprised to see him be a regular in 2024. Priced at 36, he could end up being a great mid-pricer if he does get the midfield opportunity which he had in Round 24.

Top 10 pick with monster junior numbers (109 AFL Fantasy average in WAFL Colts, three x 130+ in WAFL league), high endurance and good size. However, since being drafted, he's struggled for senior opportunity and when he's been there, it's often in the vest. After just four games in his debut season (2 as sub), Erasmus played 14 matches in 2023 (six as sub) and just four again in 2024 (three as sub and subbed out in the other). Of his six games where he wasn't sub or subbed out in 2023, he averaged an impressive 65. Two seasons on, more developed and some impressive WAFL footy behind him (including winning the best on ground in the GF), he should be able to exceed that. The issue is, I'm not more confident in him avoiding the vest. It's still going to be hard to get consistent CBAs with Brayshaw, Serong and Young taking up the majority, however I think he leapfrogs Fyfe this season and gets a decent crack. If there is a green light on selection, he's certainly worth a go at basement price, but the shadow of the vest is going to remain a constant threat. 2 MAR UPDATE: Looks like Reid has overtaken him and if he plays, sub is most likely. I'm avoiding.
