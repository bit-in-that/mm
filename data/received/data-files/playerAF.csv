Back-to-back 117 seasons, which no other player has achieved in the last five years. His season included a 62 when he battled with a knee complaint in Round 6 which he backed up with a 73, so that 117 could have been higher. He is a genuine stat-stuffer and a rare ruckman who generates scores through transition movement as much as stoppages. The threat of the Saints playing a second ruck has always been there given he shoulders so much of the load. The good news is the two candidates - Tom Campbell and Jack Hayes - have both been delisted. Saints drafted the number one ruck prospect in the draft, but he'll need time. However, the SSP signing of 26-year-old ruck Harry Boyd is certainly cause for concern. Starting the highest priced player hasn't worked in Fantasy since Tom Mitchell in 2018, so history says start someone of value and see Marshall as an upgrade target. That's how I play the game. But if Boyd isn't used, there is no reason why Marshall won't make it a hat-trick of 117+ in his age 28 season. UPDATE: Marshall is touch and go for Round 1 following a stress fracture in his pelvis. I'm not as concerned with him losing this training block as I am the Saints protecting him during the season. I can't see him rucking 85% as he's done the last two years which means a regression is certainly on the cards. I wouldn't start with him and wouldn't draft in the top 10.","Only player to be top three, two years in a row in last five years, 120+ post-bye the last two, however pre-season stress fracture in pelvis and recruitment of Boyd is enough to scare me off",NULL,"0","0",1,NULL,2,2,1,132,0,0,171,62," 9 / 23"," 18 / 23"," 4 / 23"," 2 / 23"," 0 / 23",90,76,89,84,85,81,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,117,0,111,6,127,-10,129,-12,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,117,91,90,96,99,71,NULL,13,49,44,38,30,104,NULL,138,110,122,112,115,86,73,0,2,-6,-3,28,11,NULL,14.8,5.9,5.8,26.4,0.7,4.3,11.6,7.7,4.3,30.5,0.5,5.9,NULL,NULL,1,117,117,1,3,134,138,0,25,117,NULL

While no one could have seen this level of scoring coming, the writing was on the wall. In 2022 he averaged 105 in the VFL (including a game with 36 disposals and 27 hit-outs) and finished 2nd in the BnF, despite playing just half the games. 2023 he got his chance but was injured in the first quarter of Round 1, but led the league for points per minute after his two games as solo ruck before Goldy returned to the team. With Goldy gone in 2024, Xerri finally arrived. He ranked 3rd for tackles in the comp (only ruck in the top 24) and 8th in clearances (number one ruck). Of the top five tackling ruckmen at stoppages, he was 50 clear of the next best - that's over two a game (or eight points). Outliers of this extreme could lead to a regression and a better performing Roos team shouldn't be as reliant on their big man shouldering all the load. But tackling and following up is in his nature. He's always done it and it's not going to go away. We could see a period where Xerri is the top scoring player for multiple seasons.

But considering it was a new role with less easy ball, and that a lot of that time was spend forward, a 106 average was amazing - the top mid averaged 111 and that was with 80% CBAs.

It's also good to see him back in his natural position, after Leon Cameron played him up the ground in his last two seasons. My hesitation last year was that the Giants had a number of distributors - Himmelberg, Cumming and Ash being the main competitors. In the end, Whitfield averaged the 3rd highest percentage of kick-ins across the league, so he was their clear main man and will likely remain that way. When he's in that role, he's a 110+ Fantasy prospect and while the tag and injury threat will always be there, he's an early favourite for D1 in 2025.

So when he moved to half back at the start of last season, expectations were high. He delivered, averaging 110 in the first eight rounds and displaying the thirst for the footy we love as Fantasy coaches. But outside of Fantasy coaches, his new role output attracted some criticism - with many suggesting he was far more damaging when playing on a wing than getting cheap touches in D50. Brad Scott obviously agreed, as he moved him back to the wing and a forward-of-centre role after Round 8. While his scoring wasn't as prolific (only one x 100+ score from Round 15 to Round 21), it was still very impressive, averaging 106 in this time including 123 in his L3. His price tag is very high for someone not playing one of the two roles we want - inside mid or rebounding half-back - so he doesn't present as a great starting option, but the defender status and talk of him playing more inside in 2025 means he's likely a top six defender and someone you're going to want at some stage.","Averaged 110 as a HB distributor but moved to the wing/HF mid-season where his scoring dropped a little (106), but still showed a high ability to score - inside role possible in 2025 could see him go higher",NULL,"112","131",5,NULL,9,5,5,122,35,0,145,79," 5 / 23"," 13 / 23"," 4 / 23"," 0 / 23"," 0 / 23",0,7,1,1,2,NULL,NULL,46,11,14,17,14,NULL,NULL,107,0,109,-2,105,2,108,-1,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,107,80,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,47,102,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,113,91,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,18.2,10.1,6.7,0.0,0.7,2.3,18.1,10.0,6.9,0.0,0.4,3.1,NULL,NULL,5,107,85,10,82,113,95,22,5,107,NULL

The game is speeding up, with less stoppages and tackle opportunities and at times Steele looks like he can't keep up.

Hitouts have never been his strong suit, but ruckmen normally peak after 25 and both Gawn and Grundy improved their average in the year following their first season averaging 110+. We typically see greater consistency in the top ruck tier than the other positions, which is why English's 15 point regression in 2024 was such a shock. There was a change in the ruck rule where players were able to hold a player out while the ball was in the air which didn't play into English's favour. However, it was the ease he was pushed off the ball that was alarming. I'm prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was carrying something, more than it all being down to the rule change.

So while I think he can get to a 105+ level one day, he doesn't do it the conventional way which makes him a hard one to rely on.","Back to back 93 seasons which feels low compared to the impact he'd had in that time, but maybe he's one of those who will always be better IRL than Fantasy",NULL,"0","0",28,NULL,38,64,30,108,-2,1,117,38," 0 / 25"," 8 / 25"," 11 / 25"," 1 / 25"," 0 / 25",73,78,NULL,61,66,78,NULL,0,0,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,94,0,102,-8,85,9,77,17,88,"6",NULL,1,93,88,66,34,NULL,NULL,NULL,111,61,177,335,NULL,NULL,NULL,114,109,88,44,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,22,33,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,14.4,9.0,4.2,0.0,1.4,3.2,14.3,12.7,4.5,0.0,0.6,5.4,NULL,NULL,30,93,93,50,48,114,113,0,4,93,NULL

There was the thought he would make the natural transition to the midfield and this began at the end of 2022 where he averaged 101 post-bye from 42% CBAs. However, he's remained as a forward since and considering how good he is in his role and the depth of Hawks midfield, he will likely remain as a high half forward. What helps him is the number of quality small forwards at the Hawks, so not only does he not have to play the typical small forward role (Watson and Ginni have that covered), he also avoids the best small defender. Moore had glandular fever in the preseason last year which explains his slow start but finished with a bang - 105 post bye. That's a high level to maintain for someone who gets only a handful of CBAs, but he's done it for long enough now for it to seem sustainable.

It's not the first time he's dealt with soft tissue injuries and is a big reason why the 2021 All-Australian's numbers have dropped off since.

The Blues preferred Pittonet as their number one ruck in 2023, with TDK playing second fiddle. However, he got his chance to be the sole ruck in 2024 due to Pittonet's injury and he took it with both hands. In the 10 games he played as solo ruck, he averaged 99. In the seven games playing alongside Pittonet, it dropped to 72. Interestingly, Carlton went 9-1 in games where TDK was solo ruck and 4-10 in games Pittonet played.

He averaged just 80 through the first 13 games last season and unlike 2022 (concussion) and 2023 (knee) where he went down in the first quarter early in the season, it wasn't injury related. Max Holmes' emergence off half-back took some ball away from him but it was the constant opposition attention that got him in the end. It forced Chris Scott's hand who moved the star defender into the middle in what was one of the positional moves of the season. From 0% CBAs until then to averaging 73% the rest of the way, before being injured in Round 24. It resulted in an average of 107 - he was around the ball, tackled, but also drifted back and still got his customary cheap marks in defence but avoided the opposition attention. If he continues with that form in 2025 then he's obviously discounted. However, Geelong have strengthened their midfield, so it's possible/probable that he'll move back to defence. He also has an early bye, shared with many other discounted defenders. It's also not the first time he's come into the season 'discounted' and seems to find a way to stitch up those who start with him.

However, he only averaged 90 points per game following Round 5, which was still below his 2023 average and well below the top eight mids. I can put it down to two things. Newcombe has below average tackle numbers (4.4 v 5.2 of the top 8) which is a shock given he set the AFL record for tackles on debut with 14. The Hawks also play a very quick game style, which results in low scoring for their midfield - ranked 13th in the comp (WC, Rich, Geelong and Dees the only ones worse in 2024).

His Coates Talent League numbers were also great, managing to hit the scoreboard frequently for 12 goals from nine games and averaging 29.4 disposals and 112 points. His debut season wasn't all smooth sailing though. We all hoped he would step straight into the ‘Sheezel role’, and while he did start in defence, he was also used as a mid at times and injured himself early on just two in Round 5. It was after this where he moved back to a genuine half back role, and from Round 7 to 9 he had 24 kick-ins, after taking just five in the first six weeks. He averaged 99 in these games, however developed a stress fracture to his foot which saw him miss the next seven weeks. He returned in the same role, taking over five kick-ins in each of the last seven games for an average of 94. He's eventually going to be a midfielder and like we saw with Sheezel, that could happen as soon as this year. There is also talk of him playing on a wing.

He didn't disappoint, averaging 83 in his first season before an ACL injury cut it short. He returned in Round 16 and didn't miss a beat, averaging 112 in the last three matches of 2024 before an impressive finals run which included 30 touches and a goal (109 points) in the GF to take out the Norm Smith. He did this off an ACL, so now heading into his first full pre-season, Ashcroft is poised to take his game to the next level. He's no doubt going to be a star of the comp and he has the attributes to be a Fantasy stud also, with his ability to generate uncontested marks (5.2 marks per game v 4.4 of the top eight mids) along with his natural ball-winning ability. His tackle count (2.5 per game v 5.2 of the top 8) will improve as he gets more time in the middle (27% CBAs in 2024, increased to 43% in finals). The Lions generally score quite low in Fantasy for mids, highlighted by Lachie Neale who won a Brownlow with a sub-100 average and Josh Dunkley who is averaging 10 points per game less in than when he had the same role at the Dogs. I think he can push the high-90 mark in 2025 which would be enough to make him a good starting pick, however the early bye makes it harder.

It was obviously fast-tracked by Oliver and Petracca missing, but I can see him maintaining that role even with them returning in 2025.

After a delayed start to the season after having surgery on a broken arm and a suspension in the VFL, Parker played largely forward and was even the sub when returning to the senior side. It led to an off-season move to the Roos who are crying out for someone of his calibre. The only thing is the Roos aren't short on midfielders, so there is a chance the 32-year-old will play more of a leadership role and see now more midfield time than he did last season. However, if he is in Clarkson's midfield plans, he could prove to be a to be a top six forward in 2025 - he has averaged 90+ in each of the 10 seasons prior to 2024. Unfortunately, he's not priced on his 66 2024 average as he played less than 10 regular season games, so he comes in priced at 82 which isn't enough discount to warrant a starting selection, unless we see a clear full-time mid role in the pre-season. UPDATE: Training heavily with the mids and with Wardlaw expected to miss the first chunk of the year, he's the like-for-like replacement. Price still a bit high for a 32-year-old and I've got five 'premium' mids ahead of him for attractiveness (Macrae, Smith, Daniel, Sanders), but he's probably next in line if you have your doubts on the four or wanted to start five premos. 1 MAR UPDATE: I would've liked to have a look at him before Round 1.

Removing those injured scores, Short has averaged 89 over the past two seasons, so he hasn't been as bad as it looks. Adding to this, Rioli moved to the Gold Coast in the off-season, meaning there should be more ball for Short in 2025.

Steven May takes a crazy amount of the kick-ins, and Salem took just 9% of them last year (7% post-bye the prior season). However, this increased to 27% in the final three rounds, the most it's been in that time. It netted a 96 average which is back to the level he was in 2021. A full pre-season and maintaining the kick-in role could see him bounce back in 2025 but I think I like Short a bit better around the same price.","After experimenting in the midfield/forward to start 2024, Salam returned to defence but still looked a long way off the 90+ averaging defender he's been in the past",NULL,"87","95",32,NULL,17,11,11,95,2,-15,133,5," 1 / 17"," 3 / 17"," 9 / 17"," 6 / 17"," 1 / 17",0,0,0,0,14,8,0,0,0,0,13,8,7,0,80,0,82,-2,78,2,96,-16,NULL,NULL,NULL,-5,95,70,95,89,90,79,NULL,96,163,37,59,54,71,NULL,109,88,109,103,106,97,105,-14,-25,5,-1,11,-7,NULL,13.3,6.7,5.8,0.0,0.1,2.8,18.1,10.0,6.9,0.0,0.4,3.1,NULL,NULL,32,85,77,104,122,108,91,4,7,80,NULL

In 2024, he surpassed 100 four times and averaged 77% CBAs in those and eight sub-70 games averaging 29%. Fair to say he can score when playing as the number one ruck, but when forced to spend more time forward, he scores like a key forward. Freo have signed Sean Darcy for the long-term and hope to have him on the park more in 2025, so it's hard to see Jackson having an avenue to consistent scoring unless Darcy goes down again. There is every chance this can happen based on Darcy's injury history, but for now Jackson isn't an attractive starting option. 6 FEB UPDATE: Darcy is set to miss the start of the season. If he goes into Round 1 solo, he's no doubt an attractive option in the forward line, priced at 79 when he averages 94-99 in that role.

However, he was a late out Round 17 and subbed out in Round 18 and then played just the one more game for the year where he again had nine tackles in 55% TOG. In all he finished his debut season with eight matches at just 60% TOG. Following his first full pre-season, he increased his TOG to 73%, but his PPM didn't change so it only yielded an average of 78. He wins 49% of his touches contested (top eight mids 40%) while only averaging 19 touches per game. To me he looks more like an impact / inside player and will need time to build his endurance and grow his game to average mid-to-high 20 touches. It will come, but with the Roos' midfield depth, I don't think they will be in any rush and it might be another 12 months before we see this future star really breakout in Fantasy.

It's been the story for the last few seasons as he's struggled to stay on the park. He's heading into his age 26 season, so he should be at his peak as a ruck. Following his 2021 season where he was talked about as a potential All-Australian ruck (even with a knee injury in the pre-season and a PCL injury mid-year impacting what could've been a higher average), he hasn't been able to do a full pre-season. He broke a thumb, had sore groins and then an Achilles injury saw him miss the start of the 2022 season, he then missed the practice match in 2023 after dealing with some Achilles tightness. In 2024 he missed the first five weeks with a knee injury, and then proceeded to miss six more due to other injuries. Off-season knee surgery will limit his pre-season again, but he got onto it early this time so hopefully he can complete more than he has done in the past. The reports are that he's in good shape, however Freo will likely take a cautious approach, especially as they have Luke Jackson who is more than capable in the ruck. He's averaged 95 across the last two seasons when you exclude his injured games, and that's without a pre-season. The risk is there, but I think he can manage that level if he can get through which would make him a great starting pick. The risk is reduced with the best 18 rounds early in the year, so if he looks the goods in the practice matches (noting he missed practice matches in each of the last three seasons), then I'd be confident enough to start him. UPDATE: A trip to Doha in Jan was unexpected and I'm not sure what to make of it. Has he had a setback or was it always part of the plan and will he now come back stronger? I guess the pre-season game will tell. 6 FEB UPDATE: So he's getting surgery on his ankle and will miss the start of the season. Cross him off your starting plans. Might still come at good value in draft.","Just 12 games last year with multiple injuries, hasn't had a full pre-season in four years and coming off knee surgery, but if you can handle that risk there is obvious upside give he's averaged 95 in last two years without injured games",NULL,"0","0",15,NULL,12,16,9,92,-22,-17,111,31," 0 / 12"," 1 / 12"," 9 / 12"," 4 / 12"," 3 / 12",85,35,NULL,85,65,60,24,0,0,NULL,0,0,0,0,78,0,83,-5,74,4,76,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,-6,95,86,94,65,69,73,NULL,91,73,38,178,125,93,NULL,128,108,116,83,81,86,99,-18,-7,29,-4,-5,-10,NULL,4.8,6.6,1.5,28.8,0.5,2.8,11.6,7.7,4.3,30.5,0.5,5.9,NULL,NULL,15,84,95,122,40,110,128,-18,9,78,NULL

However in recent times, he's been dealt with some horrible luck, including doing his third ACL in Round 0 last year. He miraculously recovered to play in the finals, so he's good to go for the 2025 season. However, there are still some question marks. Prior to the knee injury, Docherty had been playing midfield/wing. He averaged a career high 22% CBAs in 2023, which increased as the Blues went on their winning streak in the second half of the season. He maintained his role in Round 0. His scoring is less prolific playing in the midfield than half back, so we certainly want to see him move back behind the ball to make the decision to start a lot easier. If not, with MID-only status, you'd want him to average mid-90s to prove a good starting selection which is a big ask for someone with the injury history of Doch.

After a breakout season in 2020 which saw him increase his average by 22 points per game, he improved again in 2021 by another seven points to 95 points per game and 105 post-bye. However, he stagnated in 2022, despite increased CBA minutes, but still managed a respectable 96. Since then, nothing has gone right. In 2023 as he battled with multiple injuries - a hand injury and two concussions - which saw him have three games with less than 50% game time (7, 23 and 48) and drop his average by 20 points per game. Removing those games he averaged 86, which is still a level below his best, but it's hard to hit peak form if you miss regular games for injury. It was a similar story last year, with Simpkin on the end of a significant concussion in the practice match and missed Round 1. He also tore a tendon in his finger in the first practice match and was forced to wear a glove for the first two months of the season. He then missed four games from Round 8 with a quad complaint, but returned to post a season high 132 from a then season high 65% CBAs, after averaging 35% until then. But once again, injury hit and he missed the following week with hamstring tightness. He played out the rest of the year averaging 84, mixing his time between forward and the midfield. With forward status, he can certainly contend with the top six and average 90+ if he maintains a 65%+ CBA role. However, with the Roos increasing their midfield depth, I feel like we might see Simpkin spend more time forward in 2025 which will limit his scoring. I just want to confirm his mid/forward split in the pre-season but I'm a bit more confident in the other forwards playing a better role. UPDATE: Wardlaw going down could see Simpkin getting the midfield split we want from him, a big watch in the pre-season games but he's shaping up as a strong starting option - we how have a few to pick from in the forward line!","Was trending to be an elite Fantasy midfielder of the comp before stagnating in 2022 and multiple injuries over the last two seasons have impacted his average, but has he missed his midfield opportunity now?",NULL,"0","0",18,NULL,29,8,1,91,-6,-20,132,40," 2 / 18"," 3 / 18"," 14 / 18"," 8 / 18"," 0 / 18",65,54,63,65,50,45,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,76,0,57,19,89,-13,89,-13,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,96,96,95,88,67,60,NULL,90,36,35,65,139,165,NULL,115,110,115,114,87,79,71,-19,0,7,22,7,11,NULL,12.1,8.9,3.1,0.0,0.6,3.1,12.3,6.7,5.1,0.0,1.3,3.2,NULL,NULL,16,76,76,138,130,90,98,0,-20,76,NULL

However, a move to half-back saw him play regular football last season, playing 23 games. He started strong (83 in first seven games) but tired in the middle period where he was rested for a game and used as sub on multiple occasions. Then he got on a roll, averaging 104 in the last seven rounds of the season (108 in L5).

More impressively, he was more impactful IRL than his Fantasy 95 average suggested. He displayed a great balance of inside ball winning ability and tackles with outside run and marks. I was excited to see how he was going to back it up given he was still so raw and only had one year playing in the middle, however a pre-season foot injury saw him miss the first six weeks of the season. He was scratchy in his return, with a big loss to the Swans, where he scored 47 from 64% TOG. He backed it up with 58 and 85 in a clear sign as to why we don't like interrupted pre-seasons. He then got going, averaging 91 for a 10-week period before scoring just 40 from a full game in Round 21 and then was subbed off 'tactically' in Round 22 on just 36, a clear sign that he wasn't 100% (he did cop some heavy collisions in the month prior). His season ended the following week when he injured his collarbone on just 8, leaving him with a season average (and priced at for 2025) of 74. I have no doubt he is a 90+ midfielder on what I've seen when healthy, so as long as he gets through the pre-season, he's someone I'd be looking to start with - even with his early bye, he'll have four price rises before it anyway. 10 MAR UPDATE: The 4 price rises are going to be significant following his 129 in Round 0. The concern is the tags which will no doubt come now, but he's locked due to the cash gen (hidden price $811k) and how good his looked doing it.","Nothing went right in 2024 after a breakout 2023 where he averaged 95, I have no doubt he can return to that level as long as he's healthy which he wasn't last year",NULL,"70","90",74,NULL,64,118,25,89,-19,-21,109,8," 0 / 16"," 3 / 16"," 10 / 16"," 5 / 16"," 1 / 16",69,9,NULL,65,58,50,9,0,0,NULL,0,3,3,0,74,0,84,-10,64,10,42,32,NULL,NULL,NULL,-4,95,61,69,75,NULL,NULL,NULL,93,234,162,116,NULL,NULL,NULL,117,80,87,90,NULL,NULL,NULL,-21,-8,-6,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,9.1,10.2,2.7,0.0,0.2,4.6,14.3,12.7,4.5,0.0,0.6,5.4,NULL,NULL,71,78,95,155,41,104,117,-21,35,74,NULL

After back-to-back 109+ seasons possessing the perfect marks/tackle combo we crave in Fantasy, nothing has gone right since. In 2023 he dropped his average by a massive 25 points per game on the back of being forced to play a key defensive role early while many of the Swans' key backs went down (averaged 12% CBAs from Round 4-6, including 0% in Round 5 and averaged 84 in that time) and then popping a calf in the first minute of Round 9 when he just started building in the midfield (47% then 63% CBAs in Round 7 and 8, scoring 110 in the latter) when on 3. He returned in Round 15 when Swans beat WC by 171 and was subbed off just after half time on another low score, so the 84 season average had legitimate excuses. So when you see he averaged 14 points less than that in 2024 makes you really question things. It started on Mad Monday 2023 where he injured his shoulder and then suffered a calf injury just as he was nearing a return, meaning he missed the first 17 weeks. He returned in Round 18, scoring 44 from 62% TOG (0% CBAs), then missed the following week after pulling up sore. His defensive attributes and versatility has always been a burden for him in Fantasy, often shifted to be the loose man in defence or to a wing and play behind the ball. But never key defence. He played the final five games, averaging just 59 in the next three (25% CBAs, sub 70& TOG for two of them), but finished with 91 and 107 playing a pure defensive role. He maintained this role in finals where he averaged 75 before a hamstring injury saw him miss the prelim and GF, an indication that his body just wasn't right. Looking at it now he's still just 27, so he should be in his prime. But his role is still very much an unknown, particularly with Dean Cox now in charge. If he returns to the midfield I can see him being a knockout pick at that price and he'll enter with a chip on his shoulder. If he plays in defence, I'm not so sure. Swans have Blakey, Lloyd and Roberts who take a lot of distribution. We saw Mills average 84 in the role in 2023, albeit a more lockout one, and 91 in his four games to finish last year in the role. As a defender, a high-80s average at that price should prove to be a good selection. Fortunately we get to see what he does in the Opening Round, both scoring and role, before having to make the call. But if he scores less than 80 in a defensive role, I think I'd wait til after his Round 3 bye. UPDATE: Great pre-season and playing pure mid in match-sim, I've bumped him up a bit. 24 FEB UPDATE: Foot injury will see him miss the start of the year.","Once one of the Fantasy elite (back-to-back 109+ in '21 & '22), but had a shocking 24 months with injury, sounds like he's back fit and shaping in a midfield role, making him a perfect bounce back candidate and a top six chance",NULL,"0","0",47,NULL,41,43,3,89,-13,-36,107,44," 0 / 7"," 1 / 7"," 5 / 7"," 3 / 7"," 0 / 7",0,15,NULL,0,15,13,NULL,8,0,NULL,8,2,0,NULL,70,4,NULL,NULL,70,4,75,-1,75,"-1",NULL,3,110,109,110,92,75,74,NULL,37,8,10,49,99,89,NULL,136,130,136,103,88,86,86,-39,-1,18,17,1,4,NULL,10.4,7.0,5.4,0.0,0.3,2.3,18.1,10.0,6.9,0.0,0.4,3.1,NULL,NULL,55,71,84,182,86,94,106,-14,-25,71,NULL

He returned in Round 6 and had CBAs in his next five games, averaging 84 from 52%.

The natural on-baller, who averaged 115 in NAB League, 10 more than ex-teammate Andrew Brayshaw in the same team, scored over 130 three weeks in a row from Round 6 to Round 8. He went on to surpass 110 five more times in his next eight games, before injury struck and he missed four of the final six matches. Unfortunately, injuries have been a theme of his career. He played just 13 games last season, never playing more than five full games in a row due to recurring hamstring injuries. Cerra has now suffered five hamstring injuries in 12 months. He went overseas in the off-season to get to the bottom of the issues. If he's fully fit, he's no doubt a highly discounted option. However, even when fit in the past and putting up those 100+ scores, he was always had some low ones in there, such is the nature of playing as the 4th mid behind Cripps, Walsh and Hewett. He had 12 games under 90 in 2024 (from 13) and 11 in 2023. Picking a player at this price, you really need them to average in the mid-90s, so it's going to be hard if he keeps scoring below that mark.

However, you wouldn't think that after watching him the last three seasons. Even in his good seasons, when he didn't get the inside role, he looked a shadow of himself. Unfortunately, it has been this way for the last 36 months - from 78% CBAs in 2021 to 64% in 2022, 36% in 2023 and bottoming out at 12% last season (0% post-bye). From the outside, it appears that the Dogs wanted more pace in there and didn't want to sacrifice Bont or Libba, and preferred to pair them with Richards and Treloar. He moved to the Saints in the off-season, who ironically also have a slow midfield, however they don't have the depth of the Dogs and it appears Macrae will step straight into an inside mid role. The question is does he still have it in him? At times last year I think the game had passed him but I do have to remind myself he looked similar in his glory days when pushed out of the middle. He also managed a 129 last year in a game he had 34% CBAs and averaged 146 in his VFL games last year.

This shouldn’t come as a great surprise considering he scored over 110 twice in three games at the level in 2022. He was back in the senior side in Round 13 and didn't miss a game after that. He moved to half-back in Round 17 and played there for the final nine games of the season, averaging 79. He was back in the midfield last year with 59% CBAs but his scoring didn't pop as expected. He had a few excuses, breaking his hand early in the pre-season game and wore a glove for the first few weeks and then hurting his hamstring and didn't play after Round 17.

He was arguably best on ground in two of those games and showed that he might be a scorer after all (not many players get 27 touches as a mid in their 5th game). However, West Coast oddly rested him the next week and it halted his momentum. He averaged 62 in the next four but then got going against the Saints, having 13 touches in the second quarter (49 points) to be on 65 at half time. He was heavily tagged after half time and took his frustrations out on a tackle which saw him suspended. Post bye there were less highlights, but he did manage a career high 99 points in Round 23 on the back of 26 touches and three behinds (imagine if he kicked straight). He's had a very interrupted pre-season and missed all work pre-Christmas, so he'll likely have a slow start. I doubt he'll be a relevant player in Fantasy this year, but I no longer think he'll just be an impact player. He's going to be a premium Fantasy player in time given how good he is.","67 average isn't eye-catching, but Reid was every bit as good as advertised, interrupted pre-season may keep him limited in 2025 but natural progression should see him continue to improve",NULL,"40","55",89,NULL,113,82,88,81,NULL,0,99,43," 0 / 20"," 0 / 20"," 19 / 20"," 10 / 20"," 0 / 20",81,68,NULL,NULL,71,69,NULL,0,0,NULL,NULL,0,0,NULL,67,0,65,2,69,-2,69,-2,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,67,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,330,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,82,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8.6,10.0,2.3,0.0,0.5,4.0,14.3,12.7,4.5,0.0,0.6,5.4,NULL,NULL,88,67,NULL,209,NULL,82,NULL,NULL,NULL,67,NULL

Phillipou has all the attributes of a modern-day player - a big body, high leap, booming kick and a goal kicker.

However, it didn't eventuate. He was controversially subbed on in his debut on 68 (55% TOG), still more than 11 of his teammates who played a full game. He then averaged 82 in his next three games (40% CBAs) and looked like he was away. Not on Bevo's watch. He was subbed out the following week (39 from 42% TOG) and then started sub the following week (scored 22 from 24%), before being dropped to the VFL. He was a level above in the VFL, averaging 116 in seven games. He went on to play eight more games for the season at AFL level, but only averaged 65, spending a lot of time forward which helped him get forward status this year. Who knows what Bevo will do with him this year. The Dogs do have plenty of mids (Bont, Libba, Treloar and Richards the likely main 4), but I can see Sanders being the 5th in line and if anything happens to one of the four, Sanders will be ready to make the most of his opportunity. UPDATE: Something has happened to one of the four (Treloar out for the first two months) and Sanders appears to be the man to step up. Genuine starting option now and a nice replacement for Phillipou, if you're hesitant he's always one you can get after you see his Round 1 role like we did with Oliver, Taranto and Worpel in their second seasons, but I think I'd have the confidence to start. 14 FEB UPDATE: They were missing Bont and Libba, but pure CBA role in first practice match.

The 2020 mid-season draftee has always been a ball winner at VFL level, where he's averaged over 90 four years straight including 120 last season. He also saw regular games at AFL level, with a career high 19 in 2024. Six of those was as sub early in the year, however he began getting midfield opportunities when their mids were out and then became a midfield regular by the end of the year, attending 63% CBAs in the L5 games. His 62 average doesn't tell the full story. Removing the six games he was sub, his averages boosts to 83. Then if you just include the games he attended 60% or more CBAs (i.e. a full time mid role), he averaged 99. He moved to the Crows in the off-season but not without demand from other teams, so you'd think the Crows gave him a strong sell of a midfield role. There are a lot of names being thrown around for their midfield mix in 2024, but with Laird moving out I feel like Peatling will become their defensive midfielder given his elite tackling ability and an average of 60%+ CBAs is on the cards. All you need at his starting price is a high 80s average, which he's proven he can do at both levels. I'm liking him as a mid-priced pick. 27 FEB UPDATE: With Rankine having more CBAs than expected (and looking great) and Crouch still well and truly in the mix, Peatling saw 42% CBAs which is much lower than hoped. I'm still keen though and I dare say many will jump off as a result.","4 straight seasons of 90+ at VFL level (120 last year), averaged 83 in non sub-games in 2024 (99 in six games over 60% CBAs), now at the Crows who have a few mids but feel like he will get even more opportunity",NULL,"58","70",100,NULL,49,45,95,76,5,-2,133,6," 1 / 19"," 3 / 19"," 14 / 19"," 10 / 19"," 6 / 19",69,0,69,70,35,26,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,62,0,55,7,67,-5,86,-24,84,"-22",NULL,-21,64,50,43,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,358,362,359,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,109,74,70,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8.4,5.4,1.7,0.0,0.4,5.1,14.3,12.7,4.5,0.0,0.6,5.4,NULL,NULL,95,83,48,241,402,109,68,16,-1,64,NULL

A pre-season injury meant he wasn't available to start the season and then was forced to work hard for his spot, despite the Bombers' woes. He played seven VFL matches and had more than 30 touches in two of them. He came in for the final four games of the year and looked okay without being amazing, limited to a forward and wing role with little inside action (15% CBAs) His second season wasn't what he would've wanted either, playing just the seven games (four as sub) at AFL level and didn't attend a centre bounce, despite his stoppage game being a strength of his. In the VFL he averaged 102, up from 92 in 2023, and included a 148 to finish the year. The knock on him is his kicking, but in his third season, the Dons have to give him a crack. I'm watching with interest, however mid-only and priced at 58 (discounted on his 2023 average not 2024), means he's not a starting option. UPDATE: been dominating match-sim and turning heads at training, shaping to play in the Opening Round where luckily we won't have to make a blind call on him before Round 1. If he avoids the vest and sees 40%+ CBAs, then he's a genuine starting option. However, I've got Peatling and Doch over him for the better mid-pricers. Parish out only helps the situation. 14 FEB UPDATE: Full time mid role in practice match and delivered. Bumped him up again, but still a tricky price tag in this format. 25 FEB UPDATE: 31 touches in the pre-season match. Only 88 points due to his low marks and high handball numbers, but looks locked into an inside role with Parish out. Outperformed Peatling in the pre-season. I still rather Peatling but a 80+ score in Round 0 may make him the safer bet.","Former pick 5, just 11 games in first two seasons, mostly as sub, but VFL (102) and junior (115) numbers suggests he's a scorer if ever given the opportunity, but kicking and midfield depth holding him back",NULL,"88","109",110,NULL,120,NULL,95,73,-17,-6,63,7," 0 / 7"," 0 / 7"," 7 / 7"," 7 / 7"," 4 / 7",0,0,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,0,0,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,37,21,37,21,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,64,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,354,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,97,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,-28,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4.9,5.3,2.6,0.0,0.1,0.7,14.3,12.7,4.5,0.0,0.6,5.4,NULL,NULL,140,58,64,534,233,79,97,-28,NULL,37,NULL

He was playing an unprecedented time on ground while getting decent CBAs in a stacked Bulldog midfield and used his elite run to average 118. His season then derailed after being suspended for headbutting Zach Tuohy and then a club-imposed suspension saw him miss five of the next six weeks. He never hit the early season heights when he returned, averaging 93 post bye. His CBAs then dropped in 2023 to 31% (20% post-bye) as he spent a lot of time forward. His season high CBA game (75%), he scored 121 but never saw that number again. It was enough to give him forward status for 2024 before an ACL injury ruled him out for the entire season. A lot happened in that 12-month period and he found himself to Geelong in the offseason, a club who is in need of a CBA midfielder. After missing 2024, he gets a 30% discount on his 2023 average of 83 (well down from his 2022 average of 104), meaning he's priced at 58.

And after 75 from 52% CBAs in R1, it looked like he was going to be one of the rookies for the season. However, never went above 30% after that, and despite a 94 in R3, he quickly found himself out of the Hawks' best 22, playing as sub in R5 and dropped after R6. He then played as sub a further three times and played twice in the last eight rounds. His VFL numbers were encouraging in that time, averaging 93 for the season but had two scores 119+. He entered 2024 with some hope of a breakout, however that never happened, finishing with an average of 58 from 25% CBAs. His season high score (82) came from his season high CBAs (64%), which happened to be his last game of the year. He averaged 108 in his two VFL games in a sign that he's ready to take the leap. Unfortunately, he's lost his forward status and also has the early bye. A slight watch in case he pumps out a bit Round 0 score, but I think he will need some time before a big breakout given the tight midfield rotation at the Hawks.","Former pick 7, passes the eye test but yet to get the full-time mid role needed to take the next step, could happen this year and we'll find out early in Round 0",NULL,"64","91",111,NULL,107,71,113,73,-6,0,82,14," 0 / 20"," 0 / 20"," 20 / 20"," 13 / 20"," 2 / 20",64,11,NULL,NULL,25,20,12,0,0,NULL,NULL,0,0,0,58,0,56,2,64,-6,74,-16,NULL,NULL,NULL,-4,58,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,427,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,85,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,8.1,6.9,2.7,0.0,0.5,2.5,14.3,12.7,4.5,0.0,0.6,5.4,NULL,NULL,113,62,49,323,399,85,77,10,NULL,58,NULL

Day out to start the year didn't even help, with Ward's H&A CBAs were a career low. He played the first five matches at 23% CBAs, but played just one of the next 11 (0% CBAs) as Day returned from injury. He managed just four more games before the end of the season, but played both finals when Day was out and finally saw some midfield time, 60% CBAs for an average of 77.

In 2023 he dropped his averaged by 23 points, which was amazing given there was no injury and he was heading into his age 24 season, meaning he should be in his prime. Cumming averaged 91 in 2022 and his breakout 2021, quickly becoming the Giants' number one distributor down back as Leon played Ash on the ball and Whitfield up forward. Kingsley came in and put things straight, with Whitfield and Ash back in defence and later Himmelberg who moved back to finish the season. This pushed Cumming up to a wing, which as we know isn't a good thing for Fantasy scoring. A pre-season calf issue followed by a hamstring injury kept him on the sidelines until Round 16 in 2024 and then another hamstring strain saw him miss GWS' last five games of the home and away season before he returned for the finals. The hope is he moves back to the half-back line at the Crows or even if he plays wing, priced at 56 he should beat that by at least 20 points. The concern is his body as he's already had a hamstring injury this pre-season. As a mid-only there is also the risk he doesn't get DPP. However, if we get an indication that he's fit and playing in defence, I think he's going to be hard to pass up at that price. 13 FEB UPDATE: Sounds like he'll be more wing than half back.

Obviously a young, tall, key defender isn't going to be Fantasy relevant, and SDK averaged just 48 points in 2022 and 2023. He maintained that average for the first half of 2024 playing in the same role, before being introduced into the ruck, a position Geelong have been lacking for the last few years. While still very raw and displaying a low hitout win rate of 29% (far worse than Stanley 41%, Blit 37% and Conway 34%), he was able to showcase his athletic ability around the ground which led to a nice boost in Fantasy scoring. In the five games where he attended 40 or more ruck contests, he averaged 87. In the other 15, he averaged 45. His brother TDK took til last season before breaking out with his 88 average. He started the year 24 years of age. SDK will be 24 at the start of 2025. So if there is any indication of him playing in the ruck in 2025 (not holding my breath knowing Chris Scott), he's going to provide great value as a defender priced at 55. 13 FEB UPDATE: Conway injury news should lead to SDK starting ruck. Bumped him up a bit again. 25 FEB UPDATE: Was monstered by Draper/Bryan combo in pre-season and many will jump off now, I'm still selecting as long as he's named solo in Round 1 and scores okay in Round 0.","Key position defender was introduced into the ruck in 2024 and when he was there he scored great (87 v 43), the Cats' ruck setup has been impossible to read the last few years but if he emerges as their main ruck he has a ton of value as a defender",NULL,"54","65",112,NULL,127,154,111,70,11,0,106,12," 0 / 19"," 2 / 19"," 16 / 19"," 16 / 19"," 0 / 19",86,0,NULL,91,12,12,NULL,0,0,NULL,0,0,0,NULL,55,0,45,10,72,-17,34,22,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,55,48,29,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,461,380,398,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,65,52,36,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,19,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,6.5,8.1,3.4,5.4,0.2,1.4,18.1,10.0,6.9,0.0,0.4,3.1,NULL,NULL,111,55,48,354,405,65,54,7,0,55,NULL

He scored 118 in Round 0, which means he has a 'hidden' price of $589k, up $60k from his starting price. His hidden breakeven is around the single digits, so he's poised to go up again. Let's say he scores 50 which he’s averaged before, he'll go up approx. $100k after Round 1. We are struggling for defenders and normally we hope to get $100k over 4-5 weeks from our rooks, so this could be a free ticket to cash gen. It would also allow a look at SDK (how much ruck does he play) and even Freijah alongside Dale. There is certainly merit to the move. He's not cheap though and if that extra coin means taking it off a player you like in other positions, I wouldn't do it.

He showed he has the makings to be a star defender of the future, but injures stopped him from a full breakout. The story was much the same in 2023. He was concussed in Round 1 on 57, forcing him to miss Round 2. He returned to average just 61 in his next nine to the bye, looking a shadow of the player that broke out a year earlier. He was so far out of form that he started as sub post-bye, which is where he scored his 23. After that, he was quoted saying ""I just thought to myself to back myself. That’s when I play my best footy, when I’m just out there, playing freely and playing on instinct"". And he did. He averaged 90 in his last seven matches, which included another injury (eye) which saw him sit off just after half time and miss two more matches. He then went to another level in the finals, averaging 102, including a best on ground performance in the prelim and 22 disposals to half time (over 100) in the GF. We were all ready to pick him last year, before he unfortunately did his knee in Round 0. He's made a full recovery and ready for 2025, coming in even more discounted at a 51 price tag. There are a few red flags such as an ACL recovery (do they rest him early fresh off a flag), fighting with Zorko for distribution duties and a Round 3 bye, but if he can manage over 80 in Round 0, which I think he can, then it's worth taking a punt on all of those. UPDATE: Sounds like he's touch and go for Round 0, so I think we need to plan our teams without him. 12 FEB UPDATE: Suffered a setback with his recovery and may miss the first month of the season.

I certainly expected this to continue, however an AC injury in the pre-season saw him have a delayed start and he just never got going, in and out of the side and when playing, limited to a forward role. His season high of 99 came from his season high 12% CBAs and he ticked along nicely at VFL level averaging 107. However, Caldwell and Durham were the young players who got more midfield time and didn't disappoint. There is a bit of a logjam of mids at the Dons but I still believe Hobbs' time will come. He's one I've got my eye on in the Opening Round and might prove a big differentiator to the popular forward picks. 25 FEB UPDATE: Big score in pre-season game but was a bit sloppy with his disposal.

He's obviously a long way from it, but his debut season showed signs of the De Goey / Petracca / Dusty mould of a very dangerous forward of centre player. It's the role every football team wants but it's a very hard role to play, and when it comes to Fantasy, typically these players are better IRL than their scores suggest. He certainly didn't go on with it in his second season, averaging 6 points per game less than his debut year. He was pretty well eliminated from the centre bounce rotation (4% post-bye after 17% in 2023) and as a pure forward, it's going to be very hard for him to score. I still have hope that he can become a star in real life (and hopefully Fantasy), but I'm certainly keeping my expectations in check for this season.","Pick six of 2022 really impressed in his first season as a powerful fwd/mid which is a hard role to play, stagnated in year two and now the jury are back out",NULL,"65","74",147,NULL,142,110,117,60,-14,-6,101,11," 0 / 21"," 1 / 21"," 20 / 21"," 19 / 21"," 3 / 21",2,0,NULL,2,9,9,18,0,0,NULL,0,0,0,0,45,0,48,-3,43,2,48,-3,NULL,NULL,NULL,-3,51,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,495,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,76,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,-6,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5.9,4.5,1.9,0.0,0.7,2.3,12.3,6.7,5.1,0.0,1.3,3.2,NULL,NULL,145,48,51,461,371,66,76,-6,NULL,45,NULL

He didn't play again at AFL level that season, but after a 158 at VFL level, he featured in Round 7 in 2023 for the first time since. He was subbed out on just 18 and went back to the VFL where he scored a 130. He played again at AFL level in Round 10 where he started sub and scored just 8, and also played VFL that week for a 118. So while his career scores at AFL read 28, 18 and 8, he showed at the level below that he had something special. We then finally saw him get a decent run at AFL level, playing four games in a row at 91, despite playing just 64% TOG. He then did his syndesmosis in Round 17 on 46, and he didn't feature again. Then nothing went right in 2024. He broke a finger in a VFL practice match (so he wasn't in line for their Opening Round game) and missed the next three weeks. He returned to the VFL in Round 4 with a 120, and followed it up with 109, 103 and 89. He then injured his ankle on 6 the following game and missed six weeks.

He was in good form in the VFL prior to that breakout game, collecting 27, 23 (and eight tackles) and 32 disposals and two goals in the three weeks leading in.

Top 10 pick with monster junior numbers (109 average in WAFL Colts, three x 130+ in WAFL league), high endurance and good size. However, since being drafted, he's struggled for senior opportunity and when he's been there, it's often in the vest. After just four games in his debut season (2 as sub), Erasmus played 14 matches in 2023 (six as sub) and just four again in 2024 (three as sub and subbed out in the other). Of his six games where he wasn't sub or subbed out in 2023, he averaged an impressive 75. Two seasons on, more developed and some impressive WAFL footy behind him (including winning the best on ground in the GF), he should be able to exceed that. The issue is, I'm not more confident in him avoiding the vest. It's still going to be hard to get consistent CBAs with Brayshaw, Serong and Young taking up the majority, however I think he leapfrogs Fyfe this season and gets a decent crack.
